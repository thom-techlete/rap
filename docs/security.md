# SV RAP 8 - Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the SV RAP 8 Event Presence Management application and provides guidelines for maintaining security.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

#### Multi-layered Authentication
- **Invitation-only registration**: Users must have a valid invitation code to register
- **Admin approval required**: New accounts are inactive until approved by staff
- **Enhanced password requirements**: Minimum 12 characters with complexity validation
- **Account lockout protection**: Automatic lockout after failed login attempts
- **Session security**: Secure session configuration with limited lifetime

#### Role-based Access Control
- **Staff permissions**: Separate permissions for administrative functions
- **Login-required middleware**: All pages require authentication except login/register
- **Admin interface protection**: Enhanced security for admin areas

### 2. Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention

#### Request Rate Limiting
- **Login attempts**: 10 attempts per 5 minutes per IP
- **Registration attempts**: 5 attempts per 5 minutes per IP
- **Admin actions**: 20 requests per hour for administrative functions
- **Fallback rate limiting**: Basic protection when django-ratelimit is unavailable

#### Account Protection
- **Account lockout**: After 5 failed attempts, accounts are temporarily locked
- **IP-based tracking**: Failed attempts tracked by both user and IP
- **Automatic recovery**: Lockouts automatically expire after cooldown period

### 3. Input Validation & File Security

#### Enhanced File Upload Security
- **File type validation**: Multiple layers of file type checking
- **Size restrictions**: 5MB maximum file size for uploads
- **Content scanning**: Detection of malicious content in uploads
- **MIME type verification**: Server-side verification of file types
- **Extension filtering**: Whitelist of allowed file extensions

#### Input Sanitization
- **XSS protection**: All user inputs are properly escaped
- **SQL injection prevention**: Django ORM protects against SQL injection
- **CSRF protection**: All forms protected with CSRF tokens
- **Content type validation**: Strict content type enforcement

### 4. Security Headers & Browser Protection

#### HTTP Security Headers
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Browser-level XSS protection
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts browser features
- **HSTS**: Enforces HTTPS connections (production)

#### Content Security Policy
- **Script restrictions**: Controlled script execution
- **Style restrictions**: Secure CSS loading
- **Image policies**: Controlled image sources
- **Frame restrictions**: Prevents embedding in frames

### 5. Session & Cookie Security

#### Secure Session Management
- **Secure cookies**: Cookies marked as secure (HTTPS only)
- **HttpOnly cookies**: Prevents JavaScript access to session cookies
- **SameSite protection**: CSRF protection via SameSite attribute
- **Session expiration**: Sessions expire after 1 hour of inactivity
- **Browser close expiration**: Sessions end when browser closes

### 6. Database Security

#### Connection Security
- **SSL/TLS encryption**: Database connections use encryption
- **Connection pooling**: Secure connection management
- **Parameterized queries**: All queries use Django ORM protection
- **User permissions**: Database user has minimal required permissions

### 7. Logging & Monitoring

#### Security Event Logging
- **Authentication attempts**: All login/logout events logged
- **Failed access attempts**: Suspicious activity tracking
- **Admin actions**: All administrative actions logged
- **Security violations**: Rate limit and abuse attempts logged
- **File upload events**: File upload security events tracked

#### Log Management
- **Log rotation**: Automatic log file rotation
- **Secure storage**: Logs stored securely with restricted access
- **Retention policy**: Logs retained for security analysis
- **Alert system**: Critical security events generate alerts

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

Critical security settings are managed through environment variables:

```bash
# Core security
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DJANGO_DEBUG=False
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=yourdomain.com

# HTTPS settings
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE=True

# Database security
DB_SSLMODE=require
```

### Production Security Checklist

#### Before Deployment
- [ ] Change default secret key to a secure random value
- [ ] Set `DEBUG=False`
- [ ] Configure proper `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
- [ ] Enable HTTPS and update security settings
- [ ] Set up proper database SSL/TLS
- [ ] Configure secure session settings
- [ ] Set up log monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Review and test all security configurations

#### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Monitor security logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Review and update dependencies regularly
- [ ] Check for Django security updates
- [ ] Audit user permissions and access levels
- [ ] Review failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Validate backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Test incident response procedures

### Security Best Practices

#### For Developers
1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **Error Handling**: Never expose sensitive information in error messages
3. **Authentication**: Use Django's built-in authentication system
4. **Authorization**: Implement proper permission checks
5. **Logging**: Log security-relevant events appropriately
6. **Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies updated

#### For Administrators
1. **User Management**: Regularly review user accounts and permissions
2. **Monitoring**: Monitor logs for security events
3. **Updates**: Apply security updates promptly
4. **Backups**: Maintain secure, tested backups
5. **Access Control**: Limit administrative access to necessary personnel
6. **Incident Response**: Have a plan for security incidents

### Security Testing

#### Automated Testing
- **Static Analysis**: Regular code security scans
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated dependency vulnerability checks
- **Configuration Validation**: Security configuration testing

#### Manual Testing
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Authentication Testing**: Login/logout flow validation
- **Authorization Testing**: Permission boundary testing
- **Input Validation Testing**: XSS and injection testing

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedure

1. **Detection**: Monitor logs and alerts for security events
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate the severity and scope of the incident
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems and prevent further damage
4. **Investigation**: Analyze logs and determine the root cause
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems and implement fixes
6. **Documentation**: Document the incident and lessons learned
